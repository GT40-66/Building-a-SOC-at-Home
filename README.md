# Building-a-SOC-at-Home

<h1>Building a SOC at Home</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab, I utilized the Vultr cloud platform to build a SOC. I went from the planning phase, to building alerts and dashboards, to finally creating a ticketing system. I set up an Ubuntu CLI to run the ELK stack, Windows Server 2022 to build domain clients, Ubuntu Server, Kali Linux to brute force domain clients, Ubuntu Fleet server, and a Mythic server for C2C. 
<br />

<h2>Tools and Systems Used</h2>
Windows Server 2022, Ubuntu CLI, ElasticSearch, Kibana, Logstash, Vultr, Mythic, Kali Linux, Crowbar, Microsoft Active Directory, Sysmon
<br />

<h2>Skills Learned</h2>
- Run Sysmon to log and aggregate data<br />
- ELK to build alerts and dashboards<br />
- Create Active Directory Forest, Organizational Units within the domain, and domain user accounts<br />
- Utilize Crowbar on Kali Linux to brute force remote connection on a domain user account<br />
- Show failed and successful logon attempts in ELK dashboard</b><br />
